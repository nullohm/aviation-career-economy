## Getting Started

Welcome to Aviation Career Economy! This application is an airline simulation for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Build your own airline, buy aircraft, hire pilots, and track your flights.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Little Navmap | **Required** for airport data (45,000+ airports) |
| MSFS 2024 | Optional - app works standalone with test aircraft |
| Save System | Automatic - progress saved in local database |

### Game Start

You start with **€0 and no aircraft**. This is intentional - you build your airline from scratch!

**First Steps:**

| Step | Action |
|:----:|--------|
| 1 | Go to **Settings → Game → Developer Tools** |
| 2 | Use **Capital Injection** to add starting funds (e.g., €100,000) |
| 3 | Go to **Market** and buy your first aircraft |
| 4 | Your first pilot is already available (yourself) |

> **Tip:** Start with a small aircraft like a Cessna 172 (~€50,000) to learn the basics, then expand!

---

## Flight Planning

Create flight plans to earn money through passenger or cargo transport. Each flight generates revenue based on distance, passenger count, and aircraft type.

### Step-by-Step Guide

| Step | Action |
|:----:|--------|
| 1 | Select an aircraft from your hangar |
| 2 | Enter departure ICAO (e.g., `EDDF` for Frankfurt) |
| 3 | Enter arrival ICAO (e.g., `EDDM` for Munich) |
| 4 | Choose passenger or cargo mission |
| 5 | Click **Create Flight Plan** |

### Route Info Badge

The toolbar shows live route information:

| Info | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Distance | Route length in NM |
| Course | Bearing in degrees |
| ETA | Estimated flight time |
| Revenue | Expected earnings |

### Suggested Routes

The "Suggested Routes" tab shows routes from your departure airport to your FBOs. Click on a route to automatically fill in the ICAO codes.

### Interactive Map

The full-screen map shows all airports with unified color coding:

| Color | Airport Type |
|-------|--------------|
| Yellow | Your FBOs (with label) |
| Purple | Large airports (> 8000 ft runway) |
| Dark Blue | Medium-large airports (6000-8000 ft) |
| Blue | Medium airports (4000-6000 ft) |
| Light Blue | Small airports (2000-4000 ft) |
| Very Light | Grass strips (< 2000 ft) |

**Right-click** on an airport opens a context menu to set as departure or arrival, plus "Airport Info" for details.

### Range Circle

When a departure airport is selected, a blue circle shows the maximum range of the selected aircraft. The circle uses geodesic (great circle) calculation for accurate distance representation.

### Airspace Overlay

Toggle airspace visualization to see controlled airspace zones. Can be enabled/disabled in **Settings → General**.

### Map Attribution

| Map Style | Attribution |
|-----------|-------------|
| Street | © OpenStreetMap contributors, © CartoDB |
| Terrain | © OpenStreetMap contributors, © OpenTopoMap |
| Satellite | © Esri, Maxar, Earthstar Geographics |

### Completing a Flight

| Other Airports | Circles (size/color by runway) |
| Legend | Symbol meanings |
| Scale | Distance in NM |

### Distance Measure Tool

1. Click the ruler icon in the toolbar
2. Click on the map to set start point
3. Click again to set end point
4. Panel shows distance (NM) and bearing (°)
5. Click "Clear" to reset

### FBO Types

| Type | Monthly Rent | Route Slots |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Local | €500 | 2 |
| Regional | €1,500 | 5 |
| International | €5,000 | 10 |

### Terminal Sizes

| Ground Handling | Ground support |
| De-Icing | Winter operations |

### Passive Income

> **Setup:** FBO → Aircraft → Pilot = Daily Revenue

1. Rent an FBO at an airport
2. Station an aircraft at the FBO
3. Assign a pilot to the aircraft

Revenue depends on aircraft size, passenger capacity, and route length.

### Network Bonus

| Bonus | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| +20% | Both airports are your FBOs |

**Tip:** Open FBOs at strategically important airports that can be well connected!

---

## Scheduled Routes

Create scheduled connections between your FBOs for automated flight operations with bonus revenue.

### How It Works

| Step | Action |
|:----:|--------|
| 1 | Right-click FBO → "Create Route from..." |
| 2 | Select destination FBO |
| 3 | Assign compatible aircraft |
| 4 | Receive +30% Daily Earnings bonus |

### Routes on the Map

| Line Style | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| Green solid | Both FBOs full, aircraft assigned |
| Yellow solid | Free slots, aircraft assigned |
| Dashed | No aircraft assigned |

### Earnings Bonus

| Bonus Type | Amount | Condition |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Route Bonus | +30% | Aircraft assigned to scheduled route |
| Service Bonus | +30% | Manual flights on scheduled route |
| Network Bonus | +20% | Both airports are your FBOs |

**Bonuses stack for maximum earnings!**

### Slot Limits

**FBO Slots (by type):**

| FBO Type | Max Routes |
|----------|------------|
| Local | 2 |
| Regional | 5 |
| International | 10 |

**FBO Pair Limit:** Max 2 routes between two specific FBOs (adjustable)

### FBO Type Restrictions

| FBO Type | Route Range |
|----------|-------------|
| Local | Same country only |
| Regional | Same region (Europe, NA, etc.) |
| International | Worldwide |

### Aircraft Sizes & Terminal Compatibility

### Troubleshooting: "No Aircraft" in Selection

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Terminal too small | Upgrade terminal at destination FBO |
| Wrong location | Aircraft must be at ORIGIN FBO |
| No pilot | Assign a pilot to the aircraft |
| Already assigned | Aircraft is on another route |
| Out of range | Route exceeds aircraft range |

### Type Ratings

Pilots can only fly aircraft for which they have a type rating. More experienced pilots have more type ratings.

### Your Player Pilot

The first pilot is your player character (cannot be fired).

## Settings

Almost all economic parameters are adjustable.

### Categories

| Category | Parameters |
|----------|------------|
| **General** | Theme, Flight Plan options |
| **Economy** | Revenue rates, load factors, fuel costs, bonuses |
| **FBO** | Rents, terminal costs, service costs |
| **Aircraft** | Maintenance, insurance, depreciation |
| **Pilots** | Salary, training, rank system |
| **Game** | Achievement rewards, Developer Tools |

### Aircraft Load Factor

Control the average utilization of your aircraft capacity:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Passenger Load** | Percentage of seats filled | 100% |
| **Cargo Load** | Percentage of cargo capacity used | 100% |

Lower values simulate realistic airline operations (typically 80-85%). Revenue is reduced proportionally while operating costs remain unchanged.
